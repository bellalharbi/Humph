###I'm really going to miss this dog

So I'm naming this little project of mine after him. 

All I want this to be is a chrome extension that will allow me to add articles and article info (scraped from meta tags or defined by user (me) if those don't exist) to a table, where I can then do whatever I fucking feel like. I don't know. Why does this stuff make me so frustrated? I'm overwhelmed by how much I don't know. And, yet, I feel so alive. 

This all makes me feel like a kid again, like I'm in middle school making melodramatic web layouts and listening to The Clash.
