###I'm really going to miss this dog

So I'm naming this little project of mine after him. 

All I want this to be is a chrome extension that will allow me to add articles and article info (scraped from meta tags or defined by user (me) if those don't exist) to a table. Why does this stuff make me so frustrated? I'm overwhelmed by how much I don't know.
